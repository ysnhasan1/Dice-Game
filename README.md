### Creating a dice game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project I created a dice game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game includes two players. <br /> When the "play" button on the screen is clicked,  two random numbers are generated and matched with the players. <br /> Then the winner is displayed on the screen according to the value of the dice. If both dice are the same, the game ends in a draw.
